# What is used in this class but doesn't add any value?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a color of green"
  end

end

#Answer
# The answer here is the return in the information method. Ruby automatically returns the result of the last line of any method, so adding return to this line in the method does not add any value and so therefore should be avoided. We also never use the attr_accessor for brightness and color. Though, these methods do add potential value, as they give us the option to alter brightness and color outside the Light class.
