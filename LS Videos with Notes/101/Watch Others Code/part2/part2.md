calculating substrings
find all substrings in a string
find longest palindrome in a string


# Notes

The take away from this video was to take a problem and break it down into sub problems so that it can be solved in stages.

Through this video Chris walked the student through a number of exercises that built upon each other. In the end he noted that the end final exercise which build upon all the previous exercises was actually an exercise that was commonly given in code interviews as the only question. The question was: 'Find the length of the longest Palindrome in a string.' Which if encountered by itself would be a very difficult problem to solve, but by walking through the problem one step at a time, he showed that it is possible to solve. The question was broken down into these stages:

1. create a method to slice substrings from a string based in indices
2. create a method to give all substrings of a string
3. create a method to find all palindromes in a string
4. create a method to find the longest palindrome
5. create a method to find the length of the longest palindrome

By breaking it down as above, a very difficult problem was able to be solved in stages.
