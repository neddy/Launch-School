# Triangle Sides
# A triangle is classified as follows:
#
# equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
# isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
# scalene All 3 sides are of different length
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.
#
# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.
#
# Examples:

def triangle(*sides)
  case
  when sides.any? { |n| n <= 0 } || sides.min(2).reduce(:+) <= sides.max
    :invalid
  when sides.uniq.size == 1
    :equilateral
  when sides.uniq.size == 2
    :isosceles
  else
    :scalene
  end
end
