# The Problem
Take a 4 line input that represents numbers drawn with scores and underscores and convert it to a number as text.

Each number is 3 characters wide, and 4 characters tall, with the last line always empty.



# Examples



# Data Structure
Store numbers in a hash, with the drawn version as the key (String), and the text representation as the value.


# Algorithm

Take a 3x4 grid of characters and match it with the corresponding number. 

Deal with garble

Split multiple numbers into blocks.
