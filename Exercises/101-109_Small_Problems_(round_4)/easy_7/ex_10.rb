# The End Is Near But Not Here
# Write a method that returns the next to last word in the String passed to it as an argument.
#
# Words are any sequence of non-blank characters.
#
# You may assume that the input String will always contain at least two words.
#
# Examples:
#
# penultimate('last word') == 'last'
# penultimate('Launch School is great!') == 'is'

def penultimate(string)
  string.split[-2]
end

puts penultimate('last word') == 'last'
puts penultimate('Launch School is great!') == 'is'
