# Each
Each iterates over each item in a collection, passing each element as an argument to the block. Each returns the initial collection upon completion.


# Map
Map iterates over each item in a collection, passing each element to the block. The return value of the block is used to transform each element. Map returns a new transformed collection with the same number of elements as the original collection.


# Select
Select iterates over each element in a collection, passing each element to the block as an argument. Select uses the truthiness of the return value of the block to determine if an element should be selected. Select returns a new collection, with those elements for which the return value of the block evaluated to true.
