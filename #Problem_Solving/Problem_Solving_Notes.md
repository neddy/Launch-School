# [LS Problem Solving](https://launchschool.com/gists/c013accd)

# Understand the Problem
- Take notes on the Problem
- Make requirements and implicit knowledge explicit
- Input / Output
  - What are they? What will they look like?






# Test Cases / Examples
- Build tests
- Define edge cases
- Failures / Bad input - how to treat them?
- Ask questions to verify understanding of problem / expected output.






# Data Structures
- Decide what type of data structure will suit the problem 
- Use a structure to make the algorithm simpler
- Understand the methods associated with different data structures





# Abstraction
- Solve in 1-2 sentences, solve small problems
- Be specific
- Don't solve big problems, break it down into smaller problems if needed
- Use 1-2 sentences to solve problems
- Use abstraction and push details to methods/functions




# The Algorithm / Pseudo Code
- Create / Write pseudo code to solve the problem
